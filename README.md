<h2 align="center">Image Deblurring and Quality Enhancement using Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN)</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Implemented conditional DCGAN to improve the quality of blurry images.</li>
  <!--<li>Used U-Net architecture to encode high level features and employed transpose convolution in decoding layers to generate deblurred(sharp) images.</li>-->
  <li>Used 14 types of blurring kernel with varying filter shapes, to build a dataset of 1,31,615 blurry images with their ground truth values.</li>
  <li>Achieved better results than the existing state of the art models by combining - Perceptual, Wasserstein, Binary cross entropy and L1 loss.</li>
  <li>Obtained average PSNR and SSIM score of 68.17 and 0.9 respectively on a test sample of 5,000 images.</li>
</ul>
